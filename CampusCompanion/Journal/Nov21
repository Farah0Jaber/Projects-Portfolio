Meeting Review:
Discussed current progress, currently have most methods working in backend. 
Farah was able to implement my (Ernesto) MVC setup into the web ui aspect.
Plan on incorporating more methods such as RSVP'ing to an event and adding ratings.
Will work on getting login/sign-up page working successfully.
Need to implement method to track currently signed in user across pages, likely a cookie of sorts.
